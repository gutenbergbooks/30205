      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following pages are reprinted, with some alterations and additions,
      from the columns of the <i>Freethinker</i>. They are neither methodical
      nor exhaustive. I had the privilege of knowing Mr. Bradlaugh more or less
      intimately for twenty years. I have worked with him in the Freethought
      movement and stood by his side on many political platforms. It seemed to
      me, therefore, that if I jotted down, even in a disjointed manner, some of
      my recollections of his great personality, I should be easing my own mind
      and conferring a pleasure on many readers. Beyond that I was not
      ambitious. The time for writing Mr. Brad-laugh's life is not yet, but when
      it arrives my jottings may furnish a point or two to his biographer.

    <h2>
      REMINISCENCES OF CHARLES BRADLAUGH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I came to London, in January, 1868, I was eighteen years of age. I
      had plenty of health and very little religion. While in my native town of
      Plymouth I had read and thought for myself, and had gradually passed
      through various stages of scepticism, until I was dissatisfied even with
      the advanced Unitarianism of a preacher like the Rev. J. K. Applebee. But
      I could not find any literature in advance of his position, and there was
      no one of whom I could inquire. Secularism and Atheism I had never heard
      of in any definite way, although I remember, when a little boy, having an
      Atheist pointed out to me in the street, Naturally I regarded him as a
      terrible monster. I did not know what Atheism was except in a very vague
      way; but I inferred from the tones, expressions, and gestures of those who
      pointed him out to me, that an Atheist was a devil in human form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after I came to London I found out an old school-fellow, and went to
      lodge with his family: They were tainted with Atheism, and my once pious
      playmate was as corrupt as the rest of them. They took me one Sunday
      evening to Cleveland Hall, where I heard Mrs. Law knock the Bible about
      delightfully. She was not what would be called a woman of culture, but she
      had what some devotees of "culchaw" do not possess&mdash;a great deal of
      natural ability; and she appeared to know the "blessed book" from cover to
      cover. Her discourse was very different from the Unitarian sermons I had
      heard at Plymouth. She spoke in a plain, honest, straightforward manner,
      and I resolved to visit Cleveland Hall again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four weeks afterwards I heard Mr. Bradlaugh for the first time.
      It was a very wet Sunday evening, but as 'bus-riding was dearer then than
      it is now, and my resources were slender, I walked about three miles
      through the heavy rain, and sat on a backless bench in Cleveland Hall, for
      which I think I paid twopence. I was wet through, but I was young, and my
      health was flawless. Nor did I mind the discomfort a bit when Mr.
      Bradlaugh began his lecture. Fiery natural eloquence of that sort was a
      novelty in my experience. I kept myself warm with applauding, and at the
      finish I was pretty nearly as dry outside as inside. From that time I went
      to hear Mr. Bradlaugh whenever I had an opportunity. He became the "god"
      of my young idolatry. I used to think of him charging the hosts of
      superstition, and wish I could be near him in the fight. But it was rather
      a dream than any serious expectation of such an honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the new Hall of Science was opened I became a pretty regular
      attendant. I heard Mr. Charles Watts, who was then as now a capital
      debater; Mr. G. J. Holyoake, Mr. C. C. Cattell, Mr. Austin Holyoake. and
      perhaps one or two other lecturers whom I have forgotten. Mr. Austin
      Holyoake frequently took the chair, especially at Mr. Bradlaugh's
      lectures, and a capital chairman he was, giving out the notices in a
      pleasant, graceful manner, and pleading for financial support like a true
      man. He was working hard for the success of the enterprise himself, and
      had a right to beg help from others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh, however, was the great attraction in my case. Perhaps I was
      more impressionable at that time, but I fancy he was then at his best as
      an orator. In later life he grew more cautious under a sense of
      responsibility; he had to think what he should not say as well as what he
      should. He cultivated the art of persuasion, and he was right in doing so.
      But at the earlier period I am writing of he gave a full swing to his
      passionate eloquence. His perorations were marvellously glowing and used
      to thrill me to the very marrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually I began to make acquaintances at the Hall. I got to know Mr.
      Austin Holyoake and his charming wife, Mr. and Mrs. Bayston, Mr. Herbert
      Gilham, Mr. R. O. Smith, and other workers. By and bye I was introduced to
      Mr. Bradlaugh and shook hands with him. It was the proudest moment of my
      young life. I still remember his scrutinising look. It was keen but
      kindly, and the final expression seemed to say, "We may see more of each
      other."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1870 I wrote my first article in the <i>National Reformer</i>. For a
      year or two I wrote occasionally, and after that with tolerable frequency.
      I was also engaged in various efforts at the Hall; helping to carry on a
      Secular Sunday School, a Young Men's Secular Association, etc. Naturally I
      was drawn more and more into Mr. Bradlaugh's acquaintance, and when he
      found himself unable to continue the Logic Class he had started at the
      Hall he asked me to carry it on for him. Of course I was proud of the
      invitation. But the Class did not live long. It was not Logic, but Mr.
      Bradlaugh, that had brought the members together. Nor do I think they
      would have learnt much of the art from Mr. Bradlaugh, except in an
      empirical way. He had a very logical cast of mind, but as far as I could
      see he had little acquaintance with formal Logic as it is taught by Mill
      and Whately, whom I select as typical masters of Induction and Deduction,
      without wishing to depreciate the host of other authorities. Mr. Bradlaugh
      really gave his class lessons in Metaphysics; his talk was of substance,
      mode, and attribute, rather than of premises and conclusions. Mr.
      Bradlaugh and I were brought into closer acquaintance by the Republican
      agitation in England after the proclamation of the present French
      Republic. I attended the Republican Conference at Birmingham in 1871, when
      I first met my old friend Dr. Guest of Manchester, Mr. R. A. Cooper of
      Norwich, Mr. Daniel Baker, Mr. Ferguson the Glasgow Home Ruler, and other
      veterans of reform. We held our Conference on Sunday in the old
      meeting-place of the Secular Society, which was approached by very abrupt
      steps, and being situated over stables, was not devoid of flavor. On
      Monday the Conference was continued in one of the rooms under the Town
      Hall. A long political programme was concocted. I was elected Secretary,
      and had the honor of speaking at the public meeting in the large hall. It
      was my first appearance in such a perilous position. I was apprehensive,
      and I said so. But Mr. Bradlaugh put his hand on my shoulder and told me
      not to fear. His kind looks and words were an excellent tonic. When I rose
      to speak I thought next to nothing about the audience. I thought "Mr.
      Bradlaugh is listening, I must do my best." And now as I am writing, I
      recall his encouraging glance as I looked at him, and the applause he led
      when I made my first point. He was my leader, and he helped me in an
      elder-brotherly way. Nothing could exceed his considerate generosity.
      Other people did not see it, but I remember it, and it was typical of the
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      One incident at the Conference is worth noting. It occurred in the
      afternoon, when Mr. R. A. Cooper (I think) was in the chair. The question
      of Free Education was being discussed. Mr. Bradlaugh did not quite like
      it, nor did I. He asked me to go with him into an ante-room and consider
      an amendment. What it was I can hardly remember, although I recollect that
      Mr. Cooper was very sarcastic about it. Since then my own opinion has
      changed, as I dare say Mr. Bradlaugh's had changed; and the incident would
      not be worth recalling if it did not throw a light upon Mr. Bradlaugh's
      philosophy. He was always in favor of self-help and individual
      responsibility, and he was naturally hostile to everything that might
      weaken those precious-elements of English life.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the years immediately after the opening of the Hall of Science, Mr.
      Bradlaugh was there a good deal. Sometimes he attended the week-night
      entertainments and gave a reading from Shelley or Whittier or some other
      poet. The audience applauded as a matter of course. They always applauded
      Mr. Bradlaugh. But he was no reader. He delivered his lines with that
      straightforward sincerity which characterised his speeches. He cultivated
      none of the graces or dexterities of the elocutionist. Besides, he was too
      original to be a successful echo of other men. I think he only did justice
      to Shelley's lines "To the Men of England." But this is a piece of simple
      and vigorous declamation; very fine, no doubt but rather rhetoric than
      poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh was anything but a cold man. I should say he was electric.
      But his tastes, so far as I could discover, did not lie in the direction
      of poetry. Certainly I heard him once, in those old days, read a great
      part, if not the whole of Shelley's "Sensitive Plant." He loved Shelley,
      however, as an Atheist and a Republican, and I suppose he took Shelley's
      poetry on trust. But I do not think, though I speak under correction, that
      he cared very much for poetry <i>as such</i>. I could never discover from
      his conversation or writings that he had read a line of Shakespeare&mdash;the
      god of Colonel Ingersoll. His mind was of the practical order, like Oliver
      Cromwell's. He had a genius for public affairs. He was not only a born
      orator, but a born ruler of men. Naturally he had, as the French say, the
      defects of his qualities. And it may be that the terrible stress of his
      life tended to repress the poetical side of his nature, and less developed
      his subtlety than his strength. Yet his feelings were deep, and his heart
      was easily touched. When William O'Brien delivered that great speech in
      the House of Commons after his imprisonment by Mr. Balfour, with all its
      needless indignities, there were two men who could not restrain their
      tears. One was an Irish member. The other was Charles Bradlaugh. One who
      witnessed the scene told me it was infinitely pathetic to see that
      gigantic man, deemed so hard by an ignorant world, wiping away his tears
      at the tale of a brave man's unmerited suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh used to attend the social parties pretty often in those old
      days. He did not dance and he stood about rather awkwardly. It must have
      been a great affliction, but he bore it with exemplary fortitude. Once or
      twice I saw Mrs. Bradlaugh there. She had a full-blown matronly figure.
      Miss Alice and Miss Hypatia came frequently. They were not then living in
      the enervating air of London, and they looked extremely robust. I also
      remember the boy Charles, of whom Mr. Bradlaugh seemed very proud. He was
      a remarkably bright lad, and full of promise. But he was carried off by a
      fever. Only a day or two after the lad's death Mr. Bradlaugh had to
      lecture at the Hall. I was away, and I wondered whether he would fulfil
      the engagement. He did fulfil it. A friend wrote to me that Mr. Bradlaugh
      walked through the hall and mounted the platform with a face as white and
      rigid as that of a statue. He made no reference or allusion to his loss,
      but all could see he carried a bleeding heart. His lecturing in such
      circumstances was characteristic. Weaker men would have indulged their
      grief; he was made of sterner stuff, and would not let it interfere with
      what he deemed his duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Splendid as was his eloquence at that time, Mr. Bradlaugh did not draw the
      large audiences that flocked around him a few years later. The Hall of
      Science was at first but half its present size, the platform standing on
      the right as you entered, with a small gallery on the opposite side. Its
      holding capacity could not have been more than half what it is at present,
      yet I have seen the place far from full. But the audiences grew larger and
      larger, and eventually the hall was increased to its present proportions,
      although for a long time there was not cash enough to put on a proper
      roof, and the building was defaced by a huge unsightly beam, on each side
      of which there was an arch of corrugated iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were glorious times. Difficulties were great, but there was a spirit
      at the Hall that laughed at them. How the foremost men about the place did
      work! Mr. R. O. Smith and Mr. Trevilion, senior, could a tale unfold.
      Whenever Freethinkers are at all dejected they should have a chat with one
      of those gentleman. Perhaps it would make them ashamed of their dejection,
      and fill them with the spirit of the heroic days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friends have told me with what energy Mr. Bradlaugh fought the battles of
      the old Reform League. I <i>know</i> with what energy he threw himself
      into the Republican agitation that followed the downfall of Napoleon III.
      He tried to get to Paris but failed. Jules Favre and his friends did not
      want him. Favre himself was an eloquent historion, and no doubt he felt
      afraid of a man like Mr. Bradlaugh. But if Mr. Bradlaugh could not get to
      Paris he fought hard for France in London. Meetings at the Hall of Science
      did not suffice. There was money from French sources and St. James's Hall
      was taken for a big demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Positivists shared in the proceedings. Their chief man was Mr.
      Frederic Harrison. Mr. Bradlaugh and he were a tremendous contrast. In
      fact a London paper (I think the <i>Echo</i>) remarked that Mr. Bradlaugh
      spoke as well as Mr. Harrison wrote, and Mr. Harrison spoke as badly as
      Mr. Bradlaugh wrote. There was some truth in this, though like most
      epigrams it was not all true. Mr. Bradlaugh was a born orator, but not a
      born writer. Yet he often wrote with a forthright power, naked and
      unadorned, which could dispense with the aid of literary artifices. During
      this English agitation on behalf of France, held firmly under German feet,
      Mr. Bradlaugh came into contact with a French countess, who, I believe,
      either supplied or was the channel of supplying the necessary funds. As
      the lady is mentioned in Mr Headingley's <i>Life of Charles Bradlaugh</i>,
      which was published with Mr. Bradlaugh's sanction, there is no reason why
      I should not refer to her. She came several times to the Hall of Science,
      and I was introduced to her. She had been a beauty, and although time was
      beginning to tell on her, she retained a good deal of charm and
      distinction, which, like a true Frenchwoman, she heightened by the art of
      dressing. Then as now, of course, foul tongues wagged in foolish heads,
      and Mr. Bradlaugh's enemies were not slow to point to the French countess
      with prurient grimaces. Unable to understand friendship between man and
      woman, owing to their Puritan training or incurable rankness, they invited
      the orthodox in religion and politics to note this suspicious connection.
      Something of this malicious folly must have reached Mr. Brad-laugh's ears,
      but I imagine he was too proud and self-contained to let it disturb him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Birmingham meeting, and the founding of the Republican League,
      of which Mr. Bradlaugh became president, and I secretary, he visited Spain
      on private business, taking with him a message from the Conference to
      Senor Castelar, the leading spirit of the short-lived Spanish Republic. I
      remember writing out the message in a clear, bold hand, and addressing the
      foolscap envelope in the same way. When Mr. Bradlaugh fell among the
      Carlists he cursed my caligraphy. Happily, however, the officer who
      scrutinised that envelope could not read at all, and Mr. Bradlaugh escaped
      the consequences of being known to carry about letters addressed to the
      devilish Castelar.
    </p>
    <p>
      During Mr. Bradlaugh's first visit to America I was a frequent contributor
      to his journal, and I corresponded with him privately. I went down to
      Northampton and delivered a lecture at his request, under the auspices of
      his electoral committee. The old theatre&mdash;a dirty, ramshackle place
      as I recollect it&mdash;was crowded, and I had my first taste of the
      popularity of Mr. Bradlaugh in the borough. Every mention of his name
      excited the wildest enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Bradlaugh was lecturing in the States a general election took
      place in England. It was impossible for him to return in time, but his
      friends looked after his interests. A committee was formed at the Hall of
      Science to raise the necessary funds, and Mr. Charles Watts and I went
      down to Northampton to conduct the election. We addressed outdoor meetings
      in the day, and crowded indoor meetings at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I saw what a hold Mr. Bradlaugh had on his Northampton followers.
      They sang "Bradlaugh for Northampton" in the Circus with all the fervor of
      Scotch Covenanters on their hillsides "rolling the psalm to wintry skies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watts and I did not win the seat for Mr. Bradlaugh, nor did he win it
      himself at the next election, but we managed to increase his vote, and he
      expressed his pleasure at the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the election Mr. Bradlaugh returned to England. Mr. Watts and I
      went down with him to Northampton. There was a crowded public meeting, I
      believe in the Circus; and I saw Mr. Bradlaugh, for the first time, in the
      presence of his future constituents. They were simply intoxicated with
      excitement. The shouts of "Bradlaugh" and "Charley" were deafening. Hats
      and handkerchiefs were waved in the air. The multitude rose to its feet
      and gave its hero a splendid welcome. Then we settled down to
      speech-making, but all that followed was somewhat tame and flat after that
      first glorious outburst of popular devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next election came quickly. It resulted in the return of a Tory
      majority for Benjamin Disraeli, and Mr. Gladstone went off to sulk in his
      tent. Two Tories were returned for Radical Northampton. Mr. Bradlaugh let
      them in. He was determined to have one of the Northampton seats. To get it
      he had to make himself inevitable. He had to prove that if Northampton
      wanted two Liberal members, one of them must be Charles Bradlaugh. It took
      him thirteen years to demonstrate this, but he succeeded, as he succeeded
      in most things. At last, in 1880, he ran as official Liberal candidate
      with Mr. Labouchere, and both were returned. I assisted Mr. Bradlaugh
      during his second (1874) election. It was then that I first saw Mrs.
      Besant. She had not yet taken to the platform, but she was writing for the
      <i>National Reformer</i>, and her pen was active during the contest. Mr.
      Watts was also there. Another figure I remember was Mr. George Odger, who
      labored among the Trade Unionists of Northampton in Mr. Bradlaugh's
      interest. George Odger was one of the ablest of all the working-class
      leaders I have ever met. He came from my own county, Devonshire, being
      born at Horrabridge, on the road between Plymouth and Tavistock. He was
      honest to the heart's core, as well as very able, but he was incurably
      indolent. You never could be sure of him at a public meeting. He had to be
      looked up beforehand, or he might forget the engagement and spend his time
      more agreeably. He was passionately fond of the theatre, and could talk by
      the hour on famous performances of old actors and actresses. During the
      daytime at Northampton I had long chats with him. He objected to fine
      hotels, and he objected to walking; so I had to sit with him in the garden
      of a semi-rural public-house, where our conversation was altogether out of
      proportion to our liquor. Odger liked beer; not much of it, but just
      enough; it suited his palate and his purse; and as I drank next to
      nothing, the landlord must have thought us unprofitable customers.
    </p>

      Mr. Bradlaugh had rooms at the George Hotel. It was the Tory house, but he
      preferred it, and Mrs. Besant, Mr. Watts, and the rest of us, fed and
      slept there during the election. This gave rise to a good deal of silly
      talk among Mr. Bradlaugh's enemies.. One evening we were returning from a
      Town Hall meeting, and the Tories had been holding a small meeting at the
      "George." As we reached the foot of the stairs, we encountered a knot of
      Tories. One of them was Mr. Merewether, the Tory candidate. He was nearly
      of the same height as Mr. Bradlaugh, and well built. His friends were
      holding him back, but he broke from them, exclaiming, "Hang it! I <i>will</i>
      have a look at him." He stood at the very foot of the staircase and looked
      hard at Mr. Bradlaugh ascending. His expression was one of good-tempered
      insolence. After a long look at Mr. Bradlaugh, he returned to his friends,
      shouting, "Well, I'm damned if he's as bad-looking as I thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      I left Northampton before the close of the poll, Mr. Bradlaugh was leaving
      the same night for America, having barely time to catch the boat at
      Liverpool. I drove round with him before leaving, on a visit to some of
      the polling stations. He had paid me a modest sum for my services, but he
      found he had hardly enough to take him across the Atlantic, and he asked
      me to lend him what money I had. I fished seven or nine pounds out of my
      pocket&mdash;I forget which&mdash;and handed it to him. It was paid back
      to me by his order a few weeks subsequently; and the incident would not be
      worth mentioning if it did not throw a light on the libellous nonsense of
      Mr. Bradlaugh's enemies that he was rolling in wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      While at Northampton with Mr. Bradlaugh, and on other occasions, I saw
      something of his personal tastes and habits. He struck me as an abstemious
      man. He was far from a great eater, and I never noticed him drink anything
      at dinner but claret, which is not an intoxicating beverage. On the whole,
      I should say, it is less injurious to the stomach and brain than tea or
      coffee. He was rather fond of a cup of tea seventeen years ago, and
      latterly his fondness for it developed into something like a passion. More
      than once I found him at St. John's Wood drinking a big cup of pretty
      strong tea, and was seduced by his genial invitation into joining him in
      that reckless indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He used to smoke too in the old days, but he afterwards gave up the
      practice for several years. About seven years ago, however, he resumed it.
      I do not think he ever attained to the dignity of a pipe. He smoked
      cigars. Some time in April, 1889, I spent an hour with him at the House of
      Commons. He got the Speaker's leave to take me into the lower smoke-room,
      and we "discussed" a cigar and some claret while discussing some
      Freethought business. The claret he seemed indifferent to, but he puffed
      the cigar with an air of enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Northampton election times I used to take a good stiff daily
      walk. All through my youth I had plenty of exercise in the open air, and I
      still grow desperately fusty without a brisk tramp at least once in the
      twenty-four hours. Mr. Bradlaugh generally took a drive, and I remember
      telling him with youthful audacity that he ought to walk for his health's
      sake. Of course it was difficult for him to walk in the streets. His
      stature and bulk made him too noticeable, and mobbing was very unpleasant.
      But he might have driven out of town and trudged a mile or two on the
      country roads. My opinion is that his neglect of physical exercise helped
      to shorten his life. Occasional bouts of fishing were very well in their
      way, but <i>daily</i> exercise is the necessary thing. I do not forget the
      tremendous labor, physical as well as mental, of lecturing on burning
      questions to large audiences. All that, however, goes on in hot, crowded
      rooms, full of vitiated air; and it gives no proper exercise to the legs
      and loins or the lower vital organs. After one of my remonstrances Mr.
      Bradlaugh invited me to play a game of billiards. It was the only time I
      ever played with him. His style with the cue was spacious and splendid;
      The balls went flying about the board, and I chaffed him on his flukes. He
      had not the temperament of a billiard-player. Still, I have heard that he
      played a fair game at St. Stephen's; but I can hardly believe it without
      first-hand testimony. I am willing to believe, however, that he was a good
      chess-player. Certainly he had a head for it But chess is a vile game for
      a brain-worker, whose recreations should never involve a mental strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I first knew Mr. Bradlaugh he was living at Tottenham. I never
      visited him there, but I often called on him at his later lodgings in
      Turner-street, Commercial-road. He occupied the ground floor, consisting
      of two rooms. The back was his bedroom, and the front his library and
      workshop. It was what the Americans call a one-horse affair. Shelves all
      round the room were filled with books. Mr. Bradlaugh sat at a desk with
      his back to the fireplace. On his right was the door communicating with
      his bedroom facing him the door opening on the passage, and on his right
      (? left) the street window. The room itself could hardly have been more
      than twelve or thirteen feet square. I once told him he was too near the
      fireplace, and he said it was sometimes good to have the poker handy. At
      that I stared, and he told me the following story.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day a gentleman called on him and was invited to take a chair. He sat
      down facing Mr. Bradlaugh, and explained that he wanted advice on a very
      particular matter. God Almighty had told him to kill someone, and he had a
      difficulty in selecting a victim. Mr. Bradlaugh put his hand behind him
      and quietly grasped the poker. The inspired gentleman put the problem as a
      knotty one, and begged the assistance of the clever Iconoclast. "Well,"
      said Mr. Bradlaugh, keeping quite cool, "what do you say to the Archbishop
      of Canterbury?" "The very man!" exclaimed the inspired gentleman. He got
      Mr. Bradlaugh to give him the Archbishop's address, and said, "Good-day,"
      with a profusion of thanks. Mr. Bradlaugh went to the door to look for a
      policeman, but none was visible, and the inspired gentleman was soon out
      of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you see," said Mr. Bradlaugh, "It's good to have the poker handy. I
      never saw or heard of the man again, and I knew he couldn't get near the
      Archbishop. There are too many flunkeys in the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were my struggling days, and Mr. Bradlaugh was very kind to me. I
      remember the Sunday evening when I told him I thought of taking to the
      Freethought platform. He pointed out the hard and thorny path I should
      have to tread, but when he saw I was resolved on the attempt, he put his
      hand on my shoulder and said, "There is no young man in the movement I
      would sooner welcome."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the very same room, on another Sunday evening a little later, I first
      saw James Thomson. He came down to the Hall of Science with Mr. Bradlaugh,
      in whose employment he then was, and I gave him the article I had brought
      for the <i>National Reformer</i>. He shook hands very cordially, and I was
      delighted to meet one for whose poetry I had a profound admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also at the Hall of Science, about the same time, that I met the
      eccentric Mr. Turberville, brother to Mr. Blackmore, the novelist. He was
      a man of parts with a bee in his bonnet. He claimed kinship with
      Turberville, a minor poet of the sixteenth century, and he loved to talk
      of poetry. His knowledge of Shakespeare was profound and minute. He
      admired Mr. Bradlaugh's perorations immensely, as well as his bold defence
      of Freethought. He made out a will in Mr. Bradlaugh's favor, but he
      subsequently made another will, and died in circumstances that
      necessitated an inquest. By agreement, however, Mr. Bradlaugh obtained
      £2,500 from the estate, and the windfall came opportunely, for his
      struggles and litigations had involved him in considerable debt. I know he
      often had to borrow money on heavy interest. One day, at Turner-street, he
      told me that a creditor of this species had coolly invited him to dinner.
      "Hang it," he said, "you can't dine with a man who charges you sixty per
      cent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another recollection I have of Mr. Bradlaugh is in connexion with the
      funeral of Mr. Austin Holyoake. The death of this gentleman was a great
      loss to the Freethought cause. He was highly respected by all who knew
      him. The geniality of his disposition was such that he had many friends
      and not a single enemy. For some years he was Mr. Bradlaugh's printer and
      publisher, and a frequent contributor to his journal. He was foremost in
      every good work, but he was one of those modest men who never get the
      credit of their labors. He died at 17 Johnson's-court, Fleet-street, in an
      upstairs room above the printing office, where his devoted wife had for
      many weeks nursed his flickering life. The funeral was a notable event.
      Those of us who could afford it rode in the undertaker's coaches, and the
      rest walked in procession to Highgate Cemetery. I can still see Mr.
      Bradlaugh in my mind's eye, bustling about on the ground floor, taking
      everything as usual on his own shoulders. He sorted us in fours for the
      coaches, my <i>vis à vis</i> being James Thomson. At the graveside, after
      the reading of Austin Holyoake's own funeral service by Mr. Charles Watts,
      Mr. Bradlaugh delivered a brief address which he had written for the
      occasion. On the whole it was too much a composition, but one sentence was
      true "Bradlaugh," and it sounds in my ears still:&mdash;"Twenty years of
      friendship lie buried in that grave."
    </p>
    <p>
      How such scenes are impressed on one's memory! As I write I see the set
      face of Charles Bradlaugh. I behold the sob-shaken back and bowed head of
      Herbert Gilham just in front of me. I hear and feel the cool, rustling
      wind, like a plaintive requiem over the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, years afterwards, I saw Mr. Bradlaugh in the same cemetery,
      supporting the helpless figure of Mrs. Ernestine Rose as she left the open
      grave of the dear partner of her long life of labor for the cause of human
      redemption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to circumstances, into which I need not enter, I saw little of Mr.
      Bradlaugh between 1875 and 1880. When he was returned for Northampton I
      rejoiced, and when he was committed to the Clock Tower I saw my duty
      sun-clear. It was to participate as I could, and might, in the struggle.
      My contributions to Mr. Bradlaugh's journal were resumed, and I spoke at
      meetings in his behalf. In May, 1881, I started the <i>Freethinker</i>, my
      oldest living child. Mr. Bradlaugh acted with his natural generosity. He
      advertised my bantling gratuitously in his own journal, and gave it every
      possible facility. This was not known at the time, but I ought to state it
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout that long, terrible struggle with the House of Commons I was
      with Mr. Bradlaugh on every point. If he made a single mistake I have yet
      to see it indicated. My article in the first number of the <i>Freethinker</i>
      was entitled "Mr. Bradlaugh's Advisers." Its object was to show the
      absurdity of the plentiful advice offered him, and the absolute justice of
      the course he was pursuing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three weeks afterwards the bigots convened a ticket meeting at Exeter
      Hall. The chief promoters were Earl Percy, Sir Bartle Frere, and butcher
      Varley. Mr. Bradlaugh was afraid the meeting would have a pre-judicial
      effect on public opinion in the provinces. The fact of the <i>tickets</i>
      would be kept back, and the report would go forth that a vote was
      unanimously passed against him at a big London demonstration. It was
      necessary, therefore, that the meeting should be <i>spoiled</i>. And it <i>was</i>.
      Mr. Bradlaugh gave me the task of moving an amendment. We had a chat in
      his library at St. John's Wood, and as we parted he said, "I rely on you,
      Foote." He looked at me steadily, holding my eyes as though to read the
      depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got tickets somehow. But the Protestant Alliance smelt mischief, and
      Mr. Bradlaugh's supporters had to fight their way in. Two hundred and
      fifty police were not enough to keep them all out. I was naturally a
      marked man, and fighting had to be supplemented by diplomacy. When the
      noble Smithson (Earl Percy), had drivelled for a few minutes as chairman,
      and the resolution against Mr. Bradlaugh had been proposed and seconded by
      Sir John Kennaway and Canon Taylor, I rose to move an amendment. But the
      amendment was refused. The resolution was put, and the Christians stood up
      and voted, while the organ played "God Save the Queen." Then, at a signal,
      our people jumped on the forms, and rent the air with cheers for
      "Bradlaugh." At another signal they all trooped out, went off to
      Trafalgar-square with the big crowd outside, and passed resolutions in Mr.
      Bradlaugh's favor. The bigots' meeting was completely spoiled. They had to
      barricade the doors and keep out their own people as well as the enemy;
      the hall was never half full, and their resolution was passed after
      refusing an amendment, amidst loud execrations. Such a lesson was taught
      the bigots that they never made another attempt. Mr. Bradlaugh had trusty
      lieutenants and stern supporters, and the bigots knew he would spoil every
      <i>private</i> meeting that professed to be <i>public</i>. He acted with
      wisdom and determination, and the result showed he knew the stake he was
      playing for when he said, "I rely on you," with that steady Napoleonic
      look.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh's legal exploits, if properly recorded, would fill a
      good-sized volume. When his life is adequately written, as it will be some
      day, this department will have to be entrusted to a skilled lawyer. No
      other person could do anything like justice to a most important part of
      the career of one whom the Tories used to call "that litigious man," when
      they were trying to ruin him in the law courts and he was only defending
      himself against their base attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who had only known Mr. Bradlaugh as a platform orator had some
      difficulty in recognising him when they first met him in one of our "halls
      of justice." His whole manner was changed. He was polite, insinuating, and
      deferential. His attitude towards the judges was admirably calculated to
      conciliate their favor. I do not mean that <i>he</i> calculated. He had
      quite a superstitious veneration for judges. It was perfectly sincere and
      it never wavered. He would not hear a word against them. When he pleaded
      before them his personal sentiments ran in a line with his best interests;
      for although judges are above most temptations, their vanity is often
      sensitive, and Mr. Bradlaugh's manner was intensely flattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he followed the legal profession, Mr. Bradlaugh would have easily
      mounted to the top and earned a tremendous income. I have heard some of
      the cleverest counsel of our time, but I never heard one to be compared
      with him in grasp, subtlety and agility. He could examine and
      cross-examine with consummate dexterity. In arguing points of law he had
      the tenacity of a bull-dog and the keenness of a sleuth-hound. He always
      fortified himself with a plethora of "cases." The table in front of him
      groaned with a weight of law. Here as elsewhere he was "thorough." An
      eminent jurisprudist once remarked to me, "there is little gleaning to be
      done after Bradlaugh."
    </p>
    <p>
      As a pleader before juries, however, I doubt whether he would have
      achieved a great success. He was too much of a born orator. He began well,
      but he soon forgot the limited audience of twelve, and spoke to a wider
      circle. This is not the way to humor juries. They like to feel their own
      importance, and he succeeds best who plays upon their weakness.
      "Remember," their looks say, "you are talking to <i>us</i>; the other
      gentlemen listen accidentally; <i>we</i> make you or damn you."
    </p>
    <p>
      My first recollection of Mr. Bradlaugh in the law courts is twenty-two
      years old. How many survivors are there of the friends who filled that
      dingy old court at Westminster where he argued before a full bench of
      judges in 1869? He was prosecuted for note giving sureties in the sum of
      £400 against the appearance of blasphemy or sedition in his paper. The law
      was resuscitated in his single case to crush him; but he fought, as he
      said he would, to the bitter end, and the Gladstone Government was glad to
      repeal the obsolete enactments. The Crown retired from the suit with a <i>stet
      processus</i>, and Mr. Bradlaugh was left with the laurels&mdash;and his
      costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I obtained an hour or two's leave from my employment, and heard a portion
      of Mr. Bradlaugh's argument It gave me a new conception of his powers.
      That is the only impression I retain. The details have dropped out of my
      memory, but there remains as fresh as ever the masterful figure of Charles
      Bradlaugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best view I ever had of Mr. Bradlaugh in litigation was in the old
      Court of Queen's Bench on Tuesday and Wednesday, July 19 and 20, 1881,
      when he cross-examined poor Mr. Newdegate. For a good deal of the time I
      sat beside him, and could watch <i>him</i> closely as well as the case. By
      raising the point whether the writ against him for penalties had been
      issued before or after he gave his vote in the House, he-was able to put
      all the parties to the prosecution into-the witness-box and make them give
      an account of themselves. Mr. Newdegate was one of the victims, and the
      poor man made confessions that furnished Mr. Bradlaugh with ground for a
      successful action against him under the law of Maintenance. Mr. Newdegate
      was a hard-mouthed witness, but he-was saddled, bridled, and ridden to the
      winning-post. His lips opened literally, making his mouth like the slit of
      a pillar-box. Getting evidence from him was like extracting a rotten cork
      from the neck of a bottle but it all came out bit by bit, and the poor man
      must have left the witness-box feeling that he had delivered himself into
      the hands of that uncircumcised Philistine. His cross-examination lasted
      three hours. It was like flaying alive. Once or twice I felt qualms of
      pity for the old man, he was such an abject figure in the hands-of that
      terrible antagonist. Every card he held had to-be displayed. Finally he
      had to produce the bond of indemnity he had given the common informer
      Clarke against all the expenses he might incur in the suit; When this came
      out Mr. Bradlaugh bent down to me and said, "I have him." And he <i>did</i>
      have him. Despite the common notion that the old law of Maintenance was
      obsolete, Mr. Bradlaugh pursued him under it triumphantly, and instead of
      ruining "Bradlaugh," poor Newdegate was nearly ruined himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a contrast to Mr. Newdegate was Mr. Bradlaugh! He was the very
      picture of suppressed fire, of rampant energies held in leash: the nerves
      of the face playing like the ripple on water, the whole frame quivering,
      and the eyes ablaze. It was wonderful how he managed to keep his intellect
      alert and his judgment steady. Six hours of such work as he had in court
      that day were enough to tax the greatest strength. Before it was over I
      saw bodeful blood-rims under his eyes. It did not surprise me, on meeting
      him at the Cobden Workmen's Club the next evening, to learn that he had
      been frightfully ill. "Mr. Bradlaugh," I wrote at the time, "is a
      wonderfully strong man, but the Tories and the bigots are doing their best
      to kill him, and if this sort of thing is to continue very much longer
      they may succeed." Alas, they <i>did</i> succeed. That terrible struggle
      killed him. No man ever lived who could have passed through it unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh was clearly right on the point raised, but the jury went
      against him, apparently out of sheer prejudice. When he went out into
      Westminster Hall he was loudly cheered by a crowd of sympathisers, who, as
      the <i>Times</i> sneered, "applauded as lustily as though their champion
      had won." Precisely so. Their applause would have greeted him in the worst
      defeat. He was not a champion on whom they had "put their money." He
      represented their principles, and the <i>Times</i> forgot, if it ever
      knew, that men are devoted to leaders in proportion to the depth of the
      interests they espouse. Conviction "bears it out even to the edge of
      doom."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let me mention something that shows Mr. Bradlaugh's tact and
      consideration. My work on the <i>Freethinker</i> brought me no return. I
      had just read the proof of an article for Mr. Bradlaugh's paper. While we
      were waiting for the jury's verdict he referred to the article, and
      guessing my need he said, "Shall I give you the guinea now?" My answer was
      an expressive shrug and a motion of the eye-brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the two coins out of his pocket, he wrapt them in a piece of paper
      <i>under the table</i>, and presently slipped the packet into my hand. The
      whole proceeding touches me deeply as I recall it. He might well have
      thought only of himself in that time of suspense; but he thought of me
      too, and the precautions he took against being seen to pay me money were
      expressive of his inbred delicacy. Reader do not say the incident is
      trivial. These little things reveal the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little did I dream, as I watched Mr. Bradlaugh fighting bigotry in the law
      courts, that the time would come when he and I would be included in a
      common indictment and stand in a criminal dock together. But as the French
      say, it is always the unexpected that happens. Early in July, 1882, I was
      served with a summons from the Lord Mayor of London, ordering me to appear
      at the Mansion House on the following Tuesday and take my trial on a
      charge of Blasphemy. Two other gentlemen were included in the summons, and
      all three of us duly appeared. We were all members of the National Secular
      Society, and Mr. Bradlaugh attended to render any possible assistance. The
      case was adjourned to the following Monday, by which time a summons had
      been served on Mr. Bradlaugh, who took his place beside us in the dock.
      After an animated day's proceedings we were committed for trial at the Old
      Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of this prosecution was, of course, to stab Mr. Bradlaugh in
      the back. He had fought all the bigots face to face, and held them all at
      bay; so they put a stiletto into Sir Hardinge Giffard's hands, and paid
      him his blood-money to attack the hero from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh had to play the fox again. He wanted to gain time, and he
      wanted to be tried, if at all, in the Court of Queen's Bench. He always
      told me that being tried at the Old Bailey was going like a lamb to the
      slaughter, and that a verdict of guilty there would certainly mean twelve
      months' imprisonment. The obvious resource, therefore, was to obtain a
      writ of <i>certiorari</i> removing our indictment to the superior court.
      Happily it was in the long vacation, and application had to be made to a
      judge in chambers. By another piece of good luck, it was Mr. Justice
      Stephen who sat behind the table on the fatal morning when the writ had to
      be finally granted or refused. It was obtained on July 29, 1882. Poor Mr.
      Maloney, who represented the prosecution, was no match for Mr. Bradlaugh,
      who treated him like a child, and only let him say a word now and then as
      a special favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roaming the law courts with Mr. Bradlaugh, I was able to see his intimate
      knowledge of legal practice. He threaded the labyrinth with consummate
      ease and dexterity. We went from office to office, where everything seemed
      designed to baffle suitors conducting their own cases. Our case, too, was
      somewhat peculiar; obsolete technicalities, only half intelligible even to
      experts, met us at every turn; and when we got out into the open air I
      felt that the thing was indeed done, but that it would puzzle omniscience
      to do it in exactly the same way again. Seven pounds was spent on stamps,
      documents, and other items, and securities for costs had to be given to
      the extent of six hundred pounds. As I walked home I pondered the great
      truth that England is a free country. I had seen with my own eyes that <i>there
      is</i> one law for rich and poor. But I could not help reflecting that
      only the rich could afford it, and that the poor might as well have no law
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh next moved to quash the indictment. He argued that the
      public prosecutor's fiat was bad, as it did not name the persons who were
      to be proceeded against, and thus resembled a general warrant, which in
      the famous Wilkes case the judges had held to be invalid. On this point,
      however, two judges, one of them being Sir James Stephen, gave judgment
      against him. The case was argued on Mr. Bradlaugh's part, the judges said,
      with "great power and learning." For my part, I think he showed a greater
      knowledge of "cases" than both the legal luminaries on the bench, who laid
      their heads close together over many a knotty point of the argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beaten on the main issue, Mr. Bradlaugh was successful, however, on the
      subsidiary one. Two counts were struck out of the indictment. The excision
      made no difference to me, but a great deal of difference to him. Two
      numbers of the <i>Freethinker</i> were thus disposed of bearing the
      imprint of the Freethought Publishing Company&mdash;under which name Mr.
      Bradlaugh and Mrs. Beasant traded&mdash;and owing to the lapse of time it
      was impossible to open a fresh indictment. Of course I saw what Mr.
      Bradlaugh was driving at, and I could not but admire the way in which he
      made light of this point, arguing it baldly as a formal matter on which,
      as their lordships would see at a glance, he was absolutely entitled to a
      judgment. They would see that he was still open to all the other counts of
      the indictment, and therefore it might make very little difference, but
      right was right and law was law. Under the spell of his persuasive speech,
      it was amazing to see the judges smoothing their wrinkled fronts. I fancy
      they gave him his second point the more readily because they were against
      him on the first; indeed, they seemed to think it a pity, if not a shame,
      that all his learning and ability should be displayed for <i>nothing</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our indictment went into the list of Crown Cases Reserved, and did not
      come on for trial till the following April. Meanwhile I was prosecuted
      again, and failing to get a writ of <i>certiorari</i>, owing to the
      flagrant bigotry of Baron Huddleston and Justice North, I was tried at the
      Old Bailey, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment like a common
      thief&mdash;as Mr. Bradlaugh had predicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my trouble Mr. Bradlaugh lent me every assistance, furnishing me
      with legal books and advice and visiting me in Newgate between the first
      and second trials, while Judge North's underlings were preparing a more
      pliant jury than the one which had declined to return a verdict of guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Holloway Gaol I lost sight of Mr. Bradlaugh and everyone else, except
      persons I had no desire to see. But one morning, early in April, 1883, the
      Governor informed me that Mr. Bradlaugh was going to pay me a visit,
      having the Home Secretary's order to see me on urgent business. The same
      afternoon I was marched from my cell into one of the Governor's offices,
      where Mr. Bradlaugh was wailing. Compared with the pale prisoners I saw
      day by day, he looked the very picture of health. Fresh, clean-shaven,
      neatly dressed, he was a most refreshing sight to eyes accustomed to rough
      faces and the brown convict's garb. And it was a friend too, and I could
      take his hand and exchange human speech with him. How vivid is my
      recollection of him at that moment! He seemed in the prime of life, little
      the worse for his terrible struggles, only the gray a trifle more decided
      about the temples, but the eyes full of light, and the mobile mouth full
      of vitality. And now he is dead! Dead! It is hard to realise. But I rang
      the muffled bell as he lay fighting his last battle, and I followed his
      corpse to the grave; and I know that the worm is busy about those leonine
      features, and the rain trickles through with a scent of faded flowers.
      Yes, it is true; he <i>is</i> dead. Dead like the king and dead like the
      clown; yet living truly beyond the dust of death in the lives of others,
      an inextinguishable light, a vivifying fire, a passionate hope, an ardent
      aspiration.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      Till the Future dares
     Forget the Past, his fate and fame shall be
     An echo and a light unto eternity.
</pre>
    <p>
      On the morning of April 10, 1883, I put on my own clothes and was driven
      in a four-wheeler from Holloway Gaol to the Law Courts, in company with
      Warder Smith, who superintended the wing of the prison in which a grateful
      country lodged and boarded me at its own expense. It was lovely spring
      weather, and I felt like a man new-born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the court where the great Blasphemy case was to be tried I found
      Mr. Bradlaugh with his usual load of law books. The court was crowded with
      friends of the defendants and legal gentlemen anxious to witness the
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh applied for a separate trial, on the ground that as there
      was no charge of conspiracy it was unjust to prejudice his case by
      evidence admitted against his co-defendants; and Lord Coleridge, who
      obviously meant to see fair play, granted the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh's position was, in one sense, the most perilous he had ever
      stood in. Just as his long litigation with respect to his seat in
      Parliament was drawing to a close, and as he believed to a <i>successful</i>
      close, he had to defend himself against a charge which, if he were proved
      guilty, would entail upon him the penalty of imprisonment. Of course it
      would not have been such imprisonment as I was suffering, for Queen's
      Bench prisoners are generally sent to the civil side of Holloway Gaol. But
      <i>any</i> imprisonment at such a moment gravely imperilled his prospects
      of success in the mighty struggle with wealth, bigotry, and political
      prejudice. A sense of this fact weighed heavily upon him, but it did not
      impair his energy or intellectual alertness; indeed, he was one of those
      rare men whose faculties are sharpened by danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need not dwell upon the evidence of the prosecution. It was most
      unsatisfactory, and failed to connect Mr. Bradlaugh with the <i>Freethinker</i>.
      Sir Hardinge Giffard, therefore, almost entirely confined himself to
      playing upon the prejudices of the jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh was perfection itself in examining and cross-examining, and
      was soon on the windward side of the judge, but his address to the jury
      was too boisterous. He <i>felt</i> too much. His adversary was not under
      this disadvantage, and Sir Hardinge Giffard's address to the jury,
      considered merely as a tactical display, was better than Mr. Bradlaugh's.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second day of the trial (it lasted for three days) there occurred a
      curious episode. Just before the adjournment for luncheon Mr. Bradlaugh
      intimated that when the Court re-assembled he would call his co-defendants
      as witnesses. Lord Coleridge replied in a low, suggestive tone, "Do you
      think it necessary?" Mr. Bradlaugh rose and for the first time I saw him
      tremble. "My lord," he said, "you put upon me a grave responsibility." "I
      put no responsibility upon you," said Lord Coleridge, "it is for you to
      decide." And the stately judge glided away in his robes of office.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Bradlaugh put his co-defendants in the witness-box, one of two
      things might happen. They might decline to give evidence, as every answer
      would tend to criminate themselves; or they might exculpate Mr. Bradlaugh
      and procure their own damnation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not blame Lord Coleridge for looking at the matter in this way. But I
      naturally looked at it in a different light Mr. Bradlaugh was my general,
      and I was his lieutenant, and it was clearly my duty to sacrifice myself.
      I could release him from danger with half a dozen words, and why should I
      hesitate to say them or he to exact them? I was already in prison, and
      another conviction could add little to my misfortune, whereas he was still
      free, and his continued freedom was just then absolutely indispensable to
      our common cause. For my part, I had not a moment's hesitation. But Lord
      Coleridge's words sank into Mr. Bradlaugh's mind, and after luncheon he
      announced that he would <i>not</i> call his co-defendants. His lordship
      looked pleased, but how he frowned when Sir Hardinge Giffard complained
      that <i>he</i> was deprived of an opportunity! Lord Coleridge did not say,
      but he <i>looked</i>&mdash;"Have you no sense of decency?" Sir Hardinge
      Giffard, however, was thick-skinned. He relied on Mr. Bradlaugh's sense of
      honor, and made it the basis of an artificial grievance. He even pretended
      that Mr. Bradlaugh was <i>afraid</i> to call his co-defendants. But he
      overreached himself by this hypocrisy, and obliged Mr. Bradlaugh to put
      his co-defendants into the witness-box. We were formally tendered as
      witnesses, Mr. Bradlaugh going no further, and leaving Sir Hardinge
      Giffard to do as he would. Of course he was obliged to interrogate us, or
      look foolish after his braggadocio, and in doing so he ruined his own case
      by giving us the opportunity! of declaring that Mr. Bradlaugh was never in
      any way connected with the <i>Freethinker</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh, of course, did not in any sense sacrifice me. It would have
      been contemptible on my part to let him bear any responsibility for my own
      deliberate action, in which he was not at all implicated, and if I had not
      been tendered as a witness I should have tried to tender myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      After half an hour's deliberation the jury found Mr. Bradlaugh not guilty.
      Standing up for the verdict, with pale set face, the grateful little "not"
      fell upon his ear, and his rigidity relaxed. Tears started to <i>my</i>
      eyes, and I saw the tears in <i>his</i> eyes as I squeezed his hand in
      speechless congratulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own trial followed Mr. Bradlaugh's, and I was not found guilty. Three
      members of the jury held out against a verdict that would have disgraced a
      free country; and as the prosecution despaired of obtaining a verdict
      while Lord Coleridge presided at the trial, the Attorney-General was asked
      to allow the abandonment of proceedings. This he granted, the case was
      struck off the list, and I returned to my prison cell at Holloway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me now go back to the crowning incident of that long struggle between
      Charles Bradlaugh and the House of Commons. On May 10, 1881, the House
      passed a resolution authorising the Sergeant-at-Arms to prevent Mr.
      Bradlaugh from entering. On June 20, the jury gave a verdict in Mr.
      Newdegate's favor for the £500 penalty and costs. A motion for a new trial
      failed, and Mr. Bradlaugh appealed to the country. Enthusiastic meetings
      were held in his behalf, and he prepared a fresh <i>coup</i>. It had to be
      something striking, and it was. On the morning of August 3 Palace Yard and
      Westminster Hall were thronged with his supporters. Every one was armed
      with a petition, which he had a legal right to take to the House of
      Commons. Mr. Bradlaugh himself drove up in a hansom cab, and entered the
      precincts of the House by the private door. He made his way to the door of
      the House itself and tried to enter by a sudden effort, but he was seized
      by fourteen officials and stalwart policemen, picked for the work, and
      thrust back through the private passage into Palace Yard. Not expecting
      such indignity, he contested every inch of the ground. Inspector Denning
      said he never thought that one man could have offered such resistance. The
      small muscles of both his arms were ruptured, and a subsequent attack of
      erysipelas put his life in jeopardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was finally thrust on to the pavement in Palace Yard his coat was
      torn and the rest of his garments were disarranged. His face was livid
      with the intense exertion when I saw him a minute afterwards. There he
      stood, a great mass of panting, valiant manhood, his features set like
      granite, and his eyes fixed upon the doorway before him. He seemed to see
      nothing but that doorway. I spoke to him, and he seemed not to hear. I
      believe a mighty struggle was going on within him, perhaps the greatest
      struggle of his life. He had suffered a frightful indignity, he must have
      been tempted to avenge it, and he had but to hold up his hand to bring
      around and behind him the myriads who stood outside the railings. The
      action would have been impolitic, but what a temptation he crushed down,
      and what an effort it necessitated. Never was his heroic nature more
      sorely tried. He justified his mastery of others by his mastery of
      himself. How small in comparison seemed the mob of his enemies! I never
      admired him more than at that moment. He was superb, sublime. They had
      wound their meshes about him, and the lion had burst them. One swift,
      daring stroke had frustrated all their plans. He who was to be quietly
      suppressed by resolutions of the House had cut the knot of their policy
      asunder, made himself the hero of the hour, and fixed the nation's eyes on
      his splendid audacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaction set in after that terrible struggle, and he accepted a chair that
      was brought him. Several members passed as he sat there. One of them was
      the coward, Frank Hugh O'Donnell. He had a lady on his arm, and he passed
      with her between himself and Mr. Bradlaugh, so that her dress trailed over
      the hero's feet. It was a wretched display of insolence and cowardice. But
      the lady must be exonerated. She looked annoyed, her cheeks reddened, and
      her eyelids fell. It is so hard for a woman to resist the attraction of
      courage, and the coward by her side must have suffered in her estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a crowded meeting that evening at the Hall of Science, at which
      I had the honor of speaking, Mr. Bradlaugh's greeting was tremendous. Two
      days afterwards he was seriously ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that great constitutional struggle I was present at many
      "Bradlaugh" meetings, and I never witnessed such enthusiasm as he excited.
      No man of my time had such a devoted following.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last "Bradlaugh" demonstration I attended was on February 15, 1883, in
      Trafalgar-square. Seventy or eighty thousand people were present. There
      were four speakers, and three of them are dead, Joseph Arch being the sole
      survivor. Mr. Adams, of Northampton, lived to see his old friend take his
      seat and do good work in the House of Commons, became himself Mayor of
      Northampton, and died universally respected by his fellow-townsmen;
      William Sharman, a brave, true man, is buried at Preston; and Charles
      Bradlaugh sleeps his long sleep at Woking.
    </p>
    <p>
      For another twelve months I attended no public meetings except the silent
      ones on the exercise ground of Holloway Gaol, But I saw Mr. Bradlaugh at
      several demonstrations on various subjects after my imprisonment, and I
      could perceive no abatement of his popularity. He had his enemies and
      detractors, but the spontaneous outburst of feeling at his death proved
      his hold on the popular heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must now leap forward to that dreadful illness which left him a broken
      man. Years before, in 1882, when we were roaming the Law Courts together,
      he tapped his chest as he coughed, and seeing my anxious expression he
      told me that he brought up a good deal of phlegm in the morning, and that
      strangers who heard him clearing his chest would fancy he was very ill.
      But he looked so well that I soon dismissed the unpleasant fact, though it
      returned before his breakdown when I saw he was obliged to cancel
      engagements. I heard in 1884, though not from himself, that he had some
      heart trouble. But I was far from prepared for the shattering illness that
      laid him low in October, 1889.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I called to see him after his partial recovery I was shocked by his
      appearance. He looked twenty years older, grey, and infirm. I sat down
      half-dazed. Theoretically I knew he was mortal, but I did not realise it
      as a fact until I saw him thin and pale from the valley of the shadow of
      death. His mind was clear enough, however; and although everything about
      him was pathetic he was quite self-collected.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing he said to me I shall never forget. There had been talk of his
      wavering in his Freethought, and as he referred to this folly he spoke in
      grave impressive tones. Pointing to the humble bed, he said, "When I lay
      there and all was black the thing that troubled me least was the
      convictions of my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Words and accents were alike solemn. The cold shadow of death seemed to
      linger in the room. A moment or two later he said with a broken voice,
      "The Freethought party is a party that I love."
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory of that interview will always be a precious possession. I
      treasure it with the sacred things of my life. I had seen and touched the
      naked sincerity of a great soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Bradlaugh returned from India I called on him, and found him
      greatly improved by his voyage. I waited for him a few minutes in his
      library, as he was at lunch, and the doctors attached great importance to
      regularity in his meals. He came into the room with a most genial smile.
      His air was fresh and buoyant, and he walked over to me quickly, holding
      out his hand all the way. I took it heartily, and had a good look at him,
      which satisfied and yet dissatisfied me. He was certainly better, but I
      could not help feeling that his constitution was irrecoverably broken.
      Never again could I hope to see the grand Bradlaugh of the old fighting
      days. His mind was as brave and alert as ever, but the body was too
      obviously disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed me some of his Indian presents, of which he was justly proud,
      and then we sat down to chat. He was full of his voyage and the kindness
      he had experienced on every side. His reception in India had exceeded his
      highest anticipations, and he was looking forward to work in the House of
      Commons on behalf of our great Dependency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of his financial prospects, he told me he had received offers of
      work from several magazine editors. But he added, "one doesn't know how
      long it will last; 'tis a precarious business." His face clouded for a
      moment, and I saw he was more troubled than he cared to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing he told me which I had no right to repeat while he lived, but I
      may repeat it without a breach of confidence now that he is dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his brief stay in India he could have had plenty of money if he had
      been less scrupulous. There was nothing very dishonourable in accepting
      money from rich Hindoos, for he was poor and broken in health, and he was
      fighting for their best interests. But he was too proud to take it, and
      when wealthy natives were calling on him, he always took the precaution to
      have an English friend in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said to me, "I cannot do that. I'll live like the old Bradlaugh,
      or I'll go under."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived like the old Bradlaugh, and he went under. He took to the
      platform again to earn a livelihood, and it killed him, as his doctors had
      foreseen. I implored him at the time not to resume the lecturing. He was
      going to fulfil an old-standing engagement at Manchester in the vast St.
      James's Hall, and I begged him to cancel it. He replied that he could not
      afford to forfeit twenty pounds. "What is that to your life?" I asked. He
      only smiled grimly. His mind was made up, and he was not to be bent by
      advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday morning, February 16, 1890, Mr. Bradlaugh resigned his
      presidency of the National Secular Society, which he had held for so many
      years. The Hall of Science was packed with members, chiefly from the
      London district, but many of them from the provinces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was infinitely pathetic. One sentiment reigned in every heart.
      The Old Guard was taking leave of its General. Some of them had fought
      around him for thirty years, and the farewell was a mutilation of their
      very lives. Tears were streaming down strong faces; and they coursed down
      the strongest face of all, the face of Charles Bradlaugh, and plashed on
      the table before him. For a while he let them fall, and then he controlled
      his grief and rose to speak. But the words would not come. His frame shook
      with a great sob, and he sat down again. A second time he rose and failed.
      But the third time his strong will prevailed, and he began to speak in
      low, trembling tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was I so struck with his oratorical powers as on this occasion.
      Without once lifting his voice above the note of conversation, he swayed
      the meeting for a full half-hour, as easily and universally as the wind
      billows a cornfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      In resigning the presidency he thought it his duty to nominate a
      successor, and his choice was ratified by the meeting. He handed me the
      president's hammer after a solemn, impressive apostrophe, in which he
      expressed his hope that he might thank me, after many years, for good,
      loyal work as leader; and when I had acknowledged the lofty honor he rose
      to vacate the chair. Naturally I declined to let him do anything of the
      kind, and for a moment the two Presidents stood together in friendly
      altercation. But for once he gave way, and Charles Bradlaugh filled the
      chair to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resigning the Presidency did not mean retirement from the National Secular
      Society. At his own suggestion Mr. Bradlaugh was elected a life-member. He
      was thus a member of the Society up to the last moment of his life. Nor
      was he an inactive one. I frequently had occasion to consult him, and one
      of his last bits of work was the drawing up of a long document for the
      Society on Secular Burials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Months rolled by, and the evening came for the great debate on the Eight
      flours Bill between Mr. Bradlaugh and Mr. Hyndman. St. James's Hall was
      packed to suffocation. I sat on the platform near my old leader, and I saw
      how the effort was telling on him. His opponents in the meeting behaved
      with incredible brutality. Some of them laughed aloud when he said,
      "Believe me, this has tried me more than I had thought." But now the hero
      they laughed at is dead, and they <i>know</i> that he spoke the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time I saw Mr. Bradlaugh in public was on Wednesday evening,
      December 10, 1890, when he lectured at the Hall of Science on behalf of
      the Forder Testimonial Fund. I believe that was the last lecture he
      delivered there, if not the last lecture he delivered anywhere. He dealt
      with the Evidences of Christianity, in reference to Archdeacon Watkins'
      lectures on the Fourth Gospel, and assuredly he was as firmly sceptical as
      ever. At the close of the lecture he spoke of his theological position,
      and declared that he could not conceive of any such change of mind as glib
      gossipers were asserting of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was extremely foggy, and Mr. Bradlaugh was ill. He ought not
      to have been there at all. After struggling painfully through the lecture,
      he sat down and waited for discussion. A Christian opponent rose, and Mr.
      Bradlaugh replied; but, being in the chair, I would not allow a second
      speech, and I was glad to see him well wrapt-up, and once more in the care
      of his devoted daughter.

      Having concluded my reminiscences of Charles Bradlaugh in relation to the
      <i>events</i> of his life, I shall wind up with a little personal talk of
      a more general character.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already referred to Mr. Bradlaugh's extraordinary knowledge of the
      law. This was strikingly illustrated after the so-called Trafalgar-square
      riots. The Tories made a wanton aggression on the right of public meeting
      in London, and found a ready instrument of tyranny in Sir Charles Warren.
      No doubt there is much to be said against promiscuous meetings in
      Trafalgar-square at all hours of the day and night, but it was a
      high-handed act of brutality to prohibit <i>all</i> meetings directly it
      was known that the London Radicals were convening a Sunday demonstration
      on the Irish question. While the Radicals were chafing under this insult
      they held several stormy meetings to discuss their best policy, and at
      last a Committee was appointed to find out, if possible, the legal rights,
      of the people and the Crown. I was a member of that committee, and I am
      able to state that although we waited on several eminent lawyers, it was
      only from Mr. Bradlaugh that we obtained any light. The others talked
      vaguely about the right of public meeting, and the primary and secondary
      uses of public thoroughfares, but Mr. Bradlaugh gave us the <i>facts</i>
      of the case. Trafalgar-square was Crown property, its control was vested
      in the Commissioner of Works, and at any moment it could be absolutely
      closed to the British public.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had escaped the other lawyers, who did not find it in the Statutes at
      Large, from which the Trafalgar-square Act, probably as being a private
      one, had been excluded. Nor was it known to the Government when Sir
      Charles Warren issued his first proclamation, As Chief Commissioner of
      Police he had no authority-over the Square, and until he obtained the
      order of its proper guardians, which he did a week later, his proclamation
      was only a piece of waste paper, Mr. Bradlaugh saw this, though he said
      nothing, when the demonstration committee called upon him a few days
      before Bloody Sunday. He told them that he had an engagement in the
      provinces on that day, but if they would postpone the demonstration until
      the following Sunday he would himself lead it to Trafalgar-square. His
      offer was not accepted, however; for the committee resented the condition
      he stipulated, namely, that he should have absolute control of the
      arrangements. They thought he was taking too much upon himself. They did
      not reflect that if he who takes power without responsibility is a despot,
      he who takes responsibility without power is a fool. It was their action,
      and not his, that lost the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh made no public parade of his brave offer. It was not his
      way. But it is due to his memory that it should be put on record, so that
      posterity may know the extent of his generous courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be no doubt, I think, that Mr. Bradlaugh was less popular with
      the working-classes in London after he took peaceable possession of his
      seat in Parliament. The London masses love a fighter, and while he was
      battling for his seat he was, in my opinion, the most popular figure in
      the metropolis. The Radical workmen never tired of his demonstrations. He
      could bring fifty or a hundred thousand of them together at a few days'
      notice. And the other speakers were, for the most part, only padding to
      fill up the time. It was "Bradlaugh" the multitude came for. They waited
      to hear him speak, they applauded him to the skies, and when he had done
      they dispersed. And on such occasions he was magnificent. No one can
      conceive the power of the man who never saw him at one of these
      demonstrations. He stood like a Pharos, and the light of his face kindled
      the crests of the living waves around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was out of sympathy with the Socialist movement, which began to
      spread just as he took his seat; and being assiduous in Parliament, he was
      drawn more and more from "the Clubs," where his libellers and detractors
      wagged their tongues to some purpose. His strong individualism, as well as
      his practical good sense, made him bitterly hostile to the mildest
      proposals for putting the people's industrial interests into the hands of
      Government departments. And being a man of most positive quality, it was
      natural that he should excite the hatred of the more fanatical Socialists;
      a sentiment which, I cannot help thinking, he exasperated by his apparent
      denial of the generosity of their aims. There are men in the Socialist
      camp (and I say it without being a Socialist) who are neither "poets" nor
      "fools"&mdash;though it is no disgrace to be the former; men who have
      studied with severity and sincerity, who have made sacrifices for
      conviction, and who were sometimes hurt by his antipathy. But, on the
      other hand, he was bitterly goaded by Socialist adversaries, who denied
      his honesty, and held him up to undeserved scorn as the hireling of "the
      classes"&mdash;a charge which the more sensitive among them must now
      repent, for his death has revealed his poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh was naturally irritable, but the irritability was only on
      the surface. The waves were easily raised, but there was plenty of quiet
      sea beneath. Though giants are often phlegmatic, his big frame embedded
      highly-strung nerves. When he was put out he could storm, and he was
      misunderstood by those who took the mood for the man. Had they seen him in
      the melting mood they would have learnt that Charles Bradlaugh was a more
      composite personality than they imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last year or two of his life he underwent a wonderful
      softening. A beautiful Indian-summer light rested upon him. He was like a
      granite rock, which the sweet grass has overgrown, and from whose crevices
      peep lovely wild flowers.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      As President of the National Secular Society he did a great work. I do not
      think he had a pronounced faculty for organisation. But he was a firm,
      sagacious leader, with the personal magnetism to attract devotion. That he
      was never overbearing I will not affirm. But it is easy to organise sheep.
      One good dog will do it. Mr. Bradlaugh had to hold together a different
      species, with leaping legs, butting horns, and a less gregarious tendency.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a splendid chairman to push through a mass of business, but he
      shone less on ordinary occasions. An ideal chairman, when not promoting
      his own schemes, should be like a midwife; he should aim at a quick
      delivery and a safe birth. Mr. Bradlaugh did not always observe this rule.
      But every man has the defects of his qualities, and even the sun must be
      taken with its spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradlaugh's speeches at the annual Conferences of the National Secular
      Society are better reading than his political speeches. Being less in the
      world of practice there, and more in the world of principle, he gave play
      to his ideal nature, his words took color, and metaphors flashed like
      jewels in the sword of his orations. It was a signal proof of his power,
      that after a whole day's exhausting work, both to himself and his
      audience, he never failed to rouse the wildest enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Mr. Bradlaugh is dead I do not hesitate to repeat what I said
      during his lifetime, that his Freethought work was the most fecund and
      important. Even his great battle against the House of Commons was for
      religious freedom against bigotry, and his one great legislative
      achievement was the Act dealing with Oaths and Affirmation. His staunchest
      political supporters were his Freethought followers. His lectures, his
      personal influence, and his reputation, leavened the public mind more than
      his orthodox enemies suspected, and he created a vast quantity of raw
      material to be utilised by his successors in Secular organisation.

      In the foregoing pages I have attempted no complete sketch of Charles
      Bradlaugh. I have written, not a monograph, but a number of rough
      jottings. Yet I hope I have conveyed an impression of the man, in some
      degree faithful, to those who may have been imperfectly acquainted with
      him; and I trust the features I have presented, however baldly outlined,
      will be recognised by those who knew and loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all is said and done, I think the final impression one retains of
      Charles Bradlaugh is his <i>heroism</i>. His was cast in a great mould of
      mind and character, as well as body. Like every hero the world has ever
      seen, he had his defects and failings, for it is given to no man to be
      perfect. But positive excellence, with all its drawbacks, is far above
      negative merit. "Thou shalt" is loftier virtue than "thou shalt not," and
      the hero is superior to the saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Bradlaugh was a colossus of manhood. He was one to design, and
      dare, and do. The beaten path of mediocrity had no attraction for that
      potent spirit. He belonged to the heroic type which seeks perilous ways
      and fresh conquests. Like the hero of one of Browning's poems, he was
      "ever a fighter." In stormy times he naturally rose to the top. He was one
      of the select few, not of those who enrich the world with great
      discoveries, or new principles, or subtle perceptions of beauty&mdash;but
      those who appeal to the heroism of man's nature, without which he is at
      best but a splendid beast, and who minister to that sense of dignity which
      is the supreme necessity of our race.
